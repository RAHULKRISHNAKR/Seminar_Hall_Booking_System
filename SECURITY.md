## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us address it responsibly. Hereâ€™s how you can report it:

1. **Do Not Open a Public Issue**: To protect users, avoid disclosing security vulnerabilities publicly. Instead, contact me directly.
   
2. **Provide Detailed Information**: When reporting, please include as much detail as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue. Include:
   - The affected URL(s) or component(s)
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Any potential risks or consequences if exploited
   - Suggested fixes or recommendations (if applicable)

3. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of a security report within 72 hours and to provide an assessment and resolution plan within 7 days, if applicable.

4. **Responsible Disclosure**: After the vulnerability is resolved, we may publicly disclose the issue with acknowledgment to the reporter, provided that they are comfortable with this.
