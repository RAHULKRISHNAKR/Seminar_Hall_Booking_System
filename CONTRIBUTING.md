## Code Guidelines

- **HTML**: Follow semantic HTML practices. Use appropriate tags and attributes to ensure accessible and readable code.
- **CSS**: Keep styles organized, use comments where helpful, and follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., BEM methodology or similar).
- **JavaScript**: Ensure that code is clean and modular. Use ES6 syntax where possible and avoid global variables.
- **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic or styling decisions to help others understand your code.

## Style Guide

- Indent with 2 spaces for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use lowercase letters for HTML tags, attribute names, and CSS selectors.
- Avoid inline styles. Stick to the main CSS file to keep styles centralized.
